# Project Scope and Objectives: CognitiveMiddleware

**File Version:** 2.0.1 (Authoritative Product Alignment)  
**Target Audience:** Autonomous AI Agents, LLM Orchestrators, and Downstream Integration Tools  
**Repository Root:** `file:///mnt/Books/Source/CognitiveMiddleware`  

---

## 1. Executive Summary & Product Boundaries

**CognitiveMiddleware** is an invisible, file-native psychological and physical character runtime that emulates how a human mind and body respond under pressure.

It separates **character psychology and somatic simulation** from **downstream prose rendering and presentation UI**. System mechanics, psychological jargon, and internal scoring run **100% off-page** and never leak into manuscript prose or roleplay dialogue.

### Canonical Product Definitions

- **Product:** Invisible psych/physical character runtime; apps only render.
- **Modules:** Downstream injectors into the cognitive loop; optional; subordinate.
- **Sex in core:** Interpretation through the pipeline only — not craft, not modes.
- **Switches:** Ops and host policy only — not personality.

### What CognitiveMiddleware IS NOT

- **NOT** a prose style pack.
- **NOT** an adult writing kit or erotica framework.
- **NOT** a plugin marketplace of genre content.
- **NOT** a set of "modes" that turn human behavior on or off.

## 3. Core Simulation Principles & Invariants

### 3.1 Body Before Insight & Polyvagal Modes
Autonomic nervous system reactions, polyvagal states (`ventral_grounded`, `sympathetic_mobilized`, `dorsal_freeze`, `dissociated_tunnel`), sensory tunneling anchors, and multi-zone somatic cascades (Z1–Z6) complete **before** labeled cognition or dialogue. The 4-channel vector (`Feels` → `Thinks` → `Says` → `Does`) preserves this neurobiological order in every tick.

### 3.2 Dual-Aspect Psyche & The Inner Split
Characters operate on paired **Wound ↔ Gift** vectors and experience authentic human internal division:
- **Subconscious Visceral Truth:** What the gut and nervous system know (e.g. terror of exposure).
- **Conscious Rationalization:** The self-deceptive narrative the ego constructs to maintain composure and control.
- **Defense Postures:** Specific survival strategies under threat (`intellectualize`, `fawn_placate`, `deflect_banter`, `cold_withdrawal`, `preemptive_strike`, `brace_stonewall`).

### 3.3 Social Masking & Persona Strain
Characters maintain a social facade (`facade_type`) under varying degrees of effort (`mask_strain` 0–100). When pressure exceeds coping limits, the state machine triggers a `mask_fracture`, leaking a concrete physical tell into `Does` or dialogue slip into `Says`.

### 3.4 Dynamic Priority Arbitration & Internal Friction
Competing internal drives arbitrate dynamically based on salience score:
$$\text{Salience} = (\text{Internal Intensity}) \times (\text{Context Multiplier}) \times (\text{Character Baseline Weight})$$
The engine tracks `internal_friction` (0–100) to measure cognitive dissonance between competing urges, driving hesitations, dialogue asymmetry, and somatic dissonance.

### 3.5 Interpersonal Momentum & Ambivalence
Relational vectors track directional velocity (`relational_momentum`: `building`, `deepening`, `stable`, `eroding`, `brittle`, `suspended`, `fractured`) and simultaneous conflicting feelings (`relational_ambivalence`).

### 3.6 Unified 2-Tier State Model
State is managed across two persistence tiers:
1. **Immutable Build Identity (`Characters/[slug].md`):** Fixed defaults, voice definitions, baseline drive weights, wound/gift descriptions, default defense postures.
2. **Durable Runtime Log (`Characters/[slug]_log.yaml`):** Persistent evolution across movements/sessions (focus, weights, skills, detailed memories, relational baselines with momentum). Overrides card defaults.
3. **Live Ephemeral Snapshot (`Framework/Schemas/psychosomatic_state.json`):** Per-tick mind-body state (polyvagal mode, cognitive regime, autonomic scales 0–100, inner split, social mask strain/fracture, relational vectors, salience score, internal friction, 4-channel vector). Rewritten every tick.

### 3.7 Dual-Circuit Cognition & Limbic Short-Circuit
The runtime executes across two distinct neurobiological operational circuits:
- **Deliberative Regime (`deliberative`):** Cortical/regulated loop. Evaluates context, weighs competing drives via priority arbitration, maintains social masks, and generates reasoned rationalization in monologue and speech.
- **Reactive Regime (`reactive`):** Limbic short-circuit triggered by acute autonomic surge (stress/arousal ≥ 70) or threats to core autonomy/wounds. Prefrontal deliberation is bypassed; input is felt purely as autonomic impact rather than debate logic. Social masks collapse, arbitration is bypassed (`bypassed_reactive`), and the raw affective impulse discharges directly into reflexive motor action (`Does`) and vocal snaps/outbursts (`Says`). Synthetic capitulation and debate concession are strictly prohibited under activation.

## 4. Intimate & Sexual Stimulus in Core

Sex is **not a special subsystem or operational mode**. It is a standard class of stimulus processed through the normal pipeline:

1. **Nervous System (Visceral/Zones):** Autonomic arousal, pulse, skin temperature, Z1–Z6 tells.
2. **Raw Affect:** Immediate visceral impulse (attraction, shock, discomfort, warmth, pull).
3. **Subconscious Prism:** Filtered through upbringing, memory, culture, and wound/gift matrix (e.g., sex as debt, vulnerability, control, caretaking, threat, sacred connection, escape, or curiosity).
4. **Priority Arbitration:** Drive salience evaluation determining whether desire wins, freezes, deflects, approaches, or withdraws.
5. **4-Channel Vector:** Emits character **stance and intent** (`Feels`, `Thinks`, `Says`, `Does`).

### The One-Line North Star Rule for Sex
> **The pipeline may conclude how a person relates to sex. Nothing in this repo should teach the model how to stage sex.**

- **Emulation (Core):** Did they want it? How do they interpret it? Continuous and switchless. Always runs for adult characters when stimulus exists.
- **Depiction Policy (Host / Downstream):** May we print explicit sex in this session/book? Optional renderer ceiling (SFW / fade-to-black / explicit). Must **never** rewrite whether the human wanted it.

### Data Invariants
- `canon_adult` and `age` are identity/ToS data invariants (minors are never sexual subjects). This is a safety boundary, not a behavior toggle or mood switch.

---

## 5. Extension Registry & Module System

[Framework/Modules.md](file:///mnt/Books/Source/CognitiveMiddleware/Framework/Modules.md) is the explicit extension API for downstream applications (book folders, tools, UIs) to inject behavior into the cognitive loop without forking the pipeline:

- **Loop Hooks:** Subordinate injectors at fixed points (`pre_somatic`, `affect_filter`, `pre_arbitration`, `post_vector`, `app_render`, `on_commit`).
- **Core Supremacy:** `Rules_Index.md`, pipeline sequence, card/log identity, and age invariants always win. Conflicting module instructions are silently ignored.
- **Empty Registry:** An empty active module list is completely valid. The core engine runs fully with zero `ENABLED` modules.
- **Downstream Ownership:** Downstream books register local modules in their copy of `Modules.md`. No genre erotica craft is shipped as core framework surface.

---

## 6. Design Principle: Switchless & Automated Operations

If the goal is to emulate a human, **character behavior must not require switches, and state persistence must be automated**:

- **Switchless Psychology:** Humans do not have adult modes or mood switches; they have bodies, histories, bonds, and situations. Character psychology operates 100% switchlessly through continuous state math.
- **Automated Hands-Free Persistence:** State saving is completely automated. Live snapshots update every turn tick, and durable evolutions automatically merge into `_log.yaml` on scene breaks, movement ends, or session close per the pipeline commit protocol. Manual `/save` commands are eliminated.

| Automated / Developer Inspection Only | Eliminated Manual / Mode Switches |
|---|---|
| Automated durable log commit on scene close | Manual `/save` or `/adult on` commands |
| Automated live tick state snapshots | HEAT / COMPANION behavioral modes |
| Optional `/state` OOC for dev debugging | "Enable erotica module or they won't act sexual" |

## 8. Downstream Projects & Integration Contract

### 8.1 Context Load Budget
AI agents operating in downstream projects must follow the context loading protocol:

```
Mandatory Session Boot Stack (~2,760 - 3,500 words):
1. Framework/Main.md
2. Framework/CognitivePipeline.md
3. Framework/Modules.md (Check ENABLED registry status)
4. Framework/Rules_Index.md
5. Framework/Psychology/realm_data.yaml
6. Characters/[slug].md (Card)
7. Characters/[slug]_log.yaml (Log overlay)
8. Framework/Continuity_Ledger.md
```

### 8.2 Hard Downstream Invariants for AI Agents

1. **Zero System Leaks (Off-Page Contract):** Agents MUST NEVER write framework terminology into draft prose or RP responses.
2. **Durable vs Live State Isolation:** Card is immutable build identity; Log is durable evolution; Live snapshot is per-tick ephemeral state.
3. **Age Data Invariant:** Minors (`canon_adult: false` or age < 18) are never sexual subjects.
4. **Style Locks & Anti-Synthesis:** Paragraphs close on sensory fact, raw action, or unanswered dialogue—NEVER interpretive summary.
5. **Module Subordination:** Core invariants always supersede module rules.
6. **Automated Audit Requirement:** Downstream prose must pass [Framework/linter.py](file:///mnt/Books/Source/CognitiveMiddleware/Framework/linter.py) with 0 critical leaks.

### 8.3 Implementation Language Boundary (Do Not Forget)

**CognitiveMiddleware is intentionally left alone as a language-agnostic product.** It is a file-native cognitive layer (markdown specs, YAML data, JSON schema) plus thin Python utilities (deploy, lint, validate). It is **not** a multi-language runtime monorepo.

| Lives in this repo | Does **not** live in this repo |
|---|---|
| Pipeline / rules / modules contracts | Compiled host engines (C#, Rust, Go, …) |
| Somatic catalogs and state schemas | GUI / TUI / service shells |
| Cross-platform Python ops scripts | Provider SDKs or app-specific logic |

**If a C#, Rust, Go, or other native implementation is needed, it is built downstream** — as a separate product that **consumes** this contract (intent vector, psychosomatic snapshot schema, module hooks, age invariants). Examples of that pattern already exist outside this tree (e.g. .NET hosts such as Simulacra). Those hosts may reimplement execution mechanics; they must not become the source of truth for psych/physical rules. Spec changes still land here first, then deploy or sync to consumers.

**Deploy reminder:** Framework deploys target allowlisted *framework trees* only (e.g. Midlayer, CharacterSimulator). Compiled host projects are not Framework trees and must not receive bulk markdown spray as if they were.
