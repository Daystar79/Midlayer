# CognitiveMiddleware

**An invisible, file-native cognitive middle layer for AI-assisted long-form novel drafting.**  
*Body-first psychology, tripartite worldview filtering, and realm-aware somatics — running silently **off-page** so manuscript drafts remain clean, immersive fiction.*

---

## Executive Summary

**CognitiveMiddleware** (running on the Psyche Matrix runtime) is a file-native architecture designed to solve common AI prose defects: therapy-speak, perfect recall, symmetric ping-pong dialogue, repetitive filler, and system jargon leakage.

Instead of prompting the AI with generic instructions or letting it narrate internal system math, CognitiveMiddleware loads as an invisible cognitive layer behind your character cards and movement briefs. The matrix calculates physical reactions, bias distortions, and state shifts silently off-page, delivering pure manuscript prose.

> **Key Rule:** The matrix is a tool for the author, not content for the reader. Zero system jargon (`Realm`, `Debt Ledger`, `Prism Intercept`, `Focus Lock`) ever appears in the final manuscript.

## Core Pillars

- 🩸 **Body Before Insight** — Biological constants dictate that somatic tells (heartbeat, jaw lock, tremor) precede cognitive labeling and spoken dialogue.
- 🎭 **Tripartite Worldview Filtering** — Character perception is shaped by permanent background filters (**Cultural Bias** & **Occupation**) and a dynamic situational filter (**Cognitive Bias / Wound**) that remains `DORMANT` until activated by scene pressure.
- 🗣️ **Syntactical Speech Engine** — Dialogue is treated as behavioral action. Character registers, vocal pitch, interruption habits (`conversational_stance`), and verbal defenses adapt dynamically to somatic focus and interlocutors.
- 📈 **Transformation Engine & Ledgers** — Dynamic character growth or regression is tracked via structured YAML state logs (`[slug]_log.yaml`) and scene timeline ledgers (`Continuity_Ledger.md`), preserving immutable identity cards.
- 🛡️ **100% Off-Page Matrix Guarantee** — Automated linting enforces strict output hygiene, stripping framework jargon, therapy-speak, and debug dumps before prose is saved.

## Quick Start & Workflow

### 1. Installation & Deployment
Deploy the framework scaffolds into your novel project folder using the OS-aware launcher:

```bash
# Preferred (auto-detects Windows vs Unix):
python3 scripts/run.py deploy [target_dir]

# Unix / macOS / WSL:
scripts/unix/deploy.sh [target_dir]

# Windows PowerShell:
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/windows/deploy.ps1 [target_dir]
```

### 2. Mandatory Session Load Manifest
For every drafting session, load the canonical manifest in context:
1. `Framework/Main.md`
2. `Framework/Rules_Index.md`
3. `Framework/Psychology/realm_data.yaml`
4. Active character cards (`Characters/[slug].md`)
5. Active character state logs (`Characters/[slug]_log.yaml`)
6. `Framework/Continuity_Ledger.md`
7. `Framework/Modules.md`

### 3. Pre-Draft Ledger Integrity Pass
Before drafting, verify ledger status:
- If `Framework/Continuity_Ledger.md` or `[slug]_log.yaml` contain unsynced rows or missing snapshots, resolve them on disk.
- Execution MUST be `CLEAN` before generating manuscript prose.

### 4. Drafting Execution
Provide the AI with your **Movement Brief**. The pipeline executes silently:
`Body Baseline` → `Runtime Filters` → `Focus Shift` → `Bias Resolution` → `Somatic Precedence` → `Prism Intercept` → `Manuscript Output`.

### 5. Automated Post-Draft Linting
Run the automated linter to catch system leaks, therapy-speak, or banned dialogue tags before committing:

```bash
# Auto launcher (any OS):
python3 scripts/run.py lint Drafts/

# Platform wrappers:
scripts/unix/lint.sh Drafts/
# Windows: scripts/windows/lint.ps1 Drafts\
```

## Core Cognitive Concepts

### 1. Tripartite Worldview Filtering
Character perception and action pass through three distinct filter layers:
- **Cultural Bias (Background):** Metaphysical frame, taboos, sacred bounds, and temporal awareness (e.g., cyclic liturgy vs. linear progress).
- **Occupation (Background):** Technical lexicon, staging focus, status reflexes, and tool habits.
- **Cognitive Bias / Wound (Triggered Intercept):** Psychological wound warp (e.g., *Debt Ledger*, *Saviour Complex*, *System Architect*, *Mirror*, *Insulation*, *Dissolution*). Remains **`DORMANT`** in casual beats and activates ONLY under wound-relevant emotional pressure (**`ACTIVE`**).

### 2. Somatic Engine & The Great Wheel (10 Realms)
Physical tells are governed by `Framework/Psychology/realm_data.yaml`, mapping bracing, release, and remnants across 10 Realms:
- **Internal Realms (I-V):** Origin, Form, Identity, Will, Echoes (*Self-framing & bracing*).
- **External Realms (VI-X):** Compassion, Presence, Integration, Threshold Fear, Return (*Self meeting world*).

### 3. Transformation Engine & State Logging
Character identity cards (`[slug].md`) remain immutable build defaults. All narrative evolution (focus shifts, bias strength changes, somatic flexibility) is recorded dynamically in `Characters/[slug]_log.yaml`:
- **Snapshot:** Current `active_focus`, `latent_weights`, `bias_strength`, and `default_somatic`.
- **Temporary Effects:** Shift durations (decremented post-movement).
- **History:** Log of medium/extreme pressure deltas, timestamps, and commit IDs.
- **Human-Readable Projection:** Consolidated into `Framework/Character_Change_Log.md` post-commit.

## Optional: Character Simulator

`Simulator/CharacterRuntime.md` is an optional side tool designed for **interactive chat drop-ins and card stress-testing** before manuscript drafting.

- **Standalone Operation:** Paste `Simulator/CharacterRuntime.md` into any LLM chat interface along with a character card.
- **One-Switch Adult Toggle:** Includes `/adult on|off` (alias `/heat on|off`) for private adult RP sessions (requires `Canon Adult: YES` on cards).
- **Live Visual Motion Engine:** Integrates with `Images/CharacterRenderingEngine.md` for motion-triggered live image generation saving stills to `Images/{slug}/`.
